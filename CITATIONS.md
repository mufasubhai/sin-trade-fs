- "is my def main(): response = request(method="GET", path="/0/public/Ticker"...) function in my kraken service being used anywhere?"
- "Can you do a quick check of current unstaged git changes to see if there's anything concerning?"
- "how does that file look now?"
- "Ignoring Grafana And prometheus, look at current testing for frontend, BE and DS and highlight weaknesses. How can we implement test coverage metrics across all three?"
- Help me write tests for my ds to get to > 70% test coverage"
- "Proceed with making the changes. I will review and ask questions after the fact"
- "It looks like there was a bunch of extra/unused code in my kraken service. I've removed it to simplify the methods. Can you double check to make sure nothing ther is broken and update the kraken tests accordingly?"
- "AWesome. Now do the same thing for the BE"
- "Run me through all of the tests that have been added"
- "Is there an easy way to generate a list of all the prompts I've given you from this session?"
- "can you just give me a list of all my prompts with timestamps next to them from this session?"
- "A little too much too quickly. I've reverted local changes. Can you think of the most simple way to change it so that prometheus shows up when a service returns 200."
- "f" (short for "fix" - wanting simplest approach)
- "How about this, can you just remove the UI elements for them in the dashboard, but keep the job to ping them? I'm mainly concerned with making sure they don't sleep."
- "set to invisible"
- "A more complicated task. Look at my login page. I'm using supabase. Make a register page with state and api calls based on the registration endpoints I already have as well as the register page I have started."
- "Add back the avatar parameter. Also, thios requires email confirmation. I the response from register looks like this,open a popup that says "Registration Successful! Please check your email for the verification link, and then login" this modal should use the standard close modal I've created and then redirect the user to the login page on close. Also, the Register button should be disabled until a user has entered email, first name and last name, and password/ confirm password. Finally, re-add the a non mandatoiry avatar URL field."
- "Add frontend tests for auth."
- "YES PLEASE"



2. 03/01/2026 OpenCode (MiniMax)
- I'm getting an empty array back from supabase. Something is off with the fetching logic in my getAssetHistory method or in the frontend logic that calls it. can you help me troubleshoot
- Let me clarify. I'm debugging at the point you outlined. THe response.data is empty. here is a recent row in my asset_prices table. Fetches are happening every 5 minutes and there are 50k rows. {row data}... My backend is correctly returning values from my active_assets table using the same key.
- it's all show 0 but no errors.
- K the issue is RLS. How can I update the call for the asset_price fetch to use the supabase key instead of the authentication based on the user_id? I want to restrict the active_assets fetching to just be related to the currently logged in user, but that association doesn't exist on the asset_prices table
Me: Let me check how BackendConfig is configured to see how to use the service key. Added supabase_service client to config.py.
- I need you to update the ML logic. Right now it's using the id from the active_assets table, but it needs to use the ticker_code to compare to the from_asset_code on the asset_prices table. You can use the asset_id for ml purposes, but we need to update to use the actual ticker code in these places otherwise t he logic doesn't work. 

 


- "I want to add some machine learning to the codebase. I want to look at asset prices over time, and trigger an alert if the asset price rises to a high of a recent sin-wave esque peak to trigger a sell,, and I want to trigger a buy if it drops to a low of a recent sin-wave style peak. The goal here is swing trading..."
- "Two things. Everything should have been an hour, but make it 5 minutes for local. Also, instead of a placeholder, create a service using this https://tinloof.com/blog/how-to-build-a-waitlist-with-supabase-and-next-js for reference assuming we're using resend. Lastly, update the emails to only be sent between 8:00am and 10:00pm pacific time."
- "Error: Failed to run sql query: ERROR: 42804: foreign key constraint "ml_trade_signals_asset_id_fkey" cannot be implemented DETAIL: Key columns "asset_id" and "id" are of incompatible types: uuid and bigint."
- "Error: Failed to run sql query: ERROR: 42703: column "user_id" does not exist HINT: Perhaps you meant to reference the column "ml_model_metrics.asset_id"."
-  "ML Trading Schema for SinTrade... (SQL schema code)" - Then: "this made some assumptions about user_id. the user_id on most of my tables is an int. I have auth set up, but that is referenced by a profiles table which in my public database is the only location the uuid exists. We should be able to use the profiles table and email tok get the email address. Please do two things. Write me a sql query to update the user_id columns here to reference an int8 column instead of a uuid column. Make sure that all my ml services (backend and frontend, including notifications) send_trade_signal_alert are referencing the correct id and email knowing that we might need to reference the public.profiles table instead of the auth.users table."
- "Error: Failed to run sql query: ERROR: 42883: operator does not exist: bigint = uuid HINT: No operator matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts. Getting this error when I try and run the SQL file in supabase"
- "each email should only contain one alert per asset. Additionally, I need you to rewrite the queries to include the ticker_code on each of these tables, and use the ticker_code instead of the asset id in the email alert. Also the email alert should inclood Is Crypto True/False for each asset."
- "From the ML perspective, how does the score/confidence improve over time. Will it? Or will it just be a rough guess each time"
- "discuss option B in more detail"
- "Sure" (to implement Option B)
- (Error log with duplicate signals and resend error)
- "I forgot to mention. I want a threshhold for my sell/buy targets. It shouldn't just be if the price goes up or down. It should be if the price goes up/down, and it looks like the variation between now and the next peak is going to be > 3%."
- (Error log showing ticker_code is null and resend errors)
- (Error log showing ETH error and duplicate notifications)
- "I think this is happening at resend_client.send_email (followed by logs)"
- "I just updated resend to the most recent version. Can you audit the code around resend and make sure it look correct?"
- (Error about unverified domain)
- "The alert should only include the most recent trigger for each asset. Right now I'm getting multiple for each asset."
- "help me write new tests for ds to hit 70% testing coverage"
- "give me a transcript of all prompts from this session. Just printed out."
